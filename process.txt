+ process is An instance of  a program (e.g python intrepeters)
+ thread is an subdomain of a process a process can have multiple threads

+process takes advantage of multiple threads CPUs and cores
+seperate memory space memory is not share between processes
+Great for CPUs bound processing
+New process is stated independently from other processes
+process is interruptable and killable
+One Gil for each process => avoids Gil limitation

-Heavyweight
-Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
-IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
