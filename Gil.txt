GIL:global integrated lock
A lock that allows only one thread at a time to be executed in python

needed in Cpython because memory managment is not thread safe

Avoid:
use multiprocessing
use a different ,free-threaded python implentation (Jython,Ironpython)
use python as wrapper forthird party libraries as (c/c++) like numpy and scipy
